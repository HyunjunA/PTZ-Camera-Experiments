Run 'FocuserExample.py' 
Check whether IRCUT is closed. If IRCUT is 0, it is closed. If it is 1, it is open. It should be closed before running the cron code.
Set zoom and focus.
Check any job is running. If you want to kill any jobs before running the job, which is to take images, run 'removeCurrentJobs.py'
If every thing are set, run 'TimedImageCapCron.py'
